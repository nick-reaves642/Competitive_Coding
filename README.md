# Competitive_Coding

This repository is for those who wish to start copetitive coding but are confused on how to start coding. 

##  Tip for the Beginners
If you are an absolute beginner in coding, I recommend you to first go through how importing the code from packages or modules work and then go thrugh the maths section first and then approach the algorithms. As after this section, you will get a good grip on how to deal with large numbers, such as 10^9+7 or 10^18, and their modulos and basic algorithms such as factorials for large numbers, modular exponentiation, multiplicative inverse and much more.
