# Competitive_Coding

This repository is for those who wish to start copetitive coding but are confused on how to start coding. 

##  Tip for the Beginners
If you are an absolute beginner in coding, I recommend you to first go through how importing the code from packages or modules work and then go through the maths section and finally, approach the algorithms/code. As after this section, you will get a good grip on how to deal with large numbers, such as 10^9+7 or 10^18, and their modulos and basic algorithms such as factorials for large numbers, modular exponentiation, multiplicative inverse and much more.
